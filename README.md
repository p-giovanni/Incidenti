## Disclaimer
I do know very well Pandas, Matplotlib and I had a fairly good education in statistics, but as all the programmers I do bugs.
So beware, I have checked the results as carefully as I can but nevertheless do not take for granted my result, check by yourself my 
code and decide it it is correct or not.
